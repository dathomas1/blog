Key Verses: Luke 5:17-26

Luke 5:21 – Who can forgive sins but God alone?

Sin is a breach of faith or an offense against God. (Leviticus 6). Sin isn’t our own perception of what’s right and wrong, but it’s us rebelling against what God has instructed us to do. Some people want to ascribe more “actions” unto God’s commandments than what God instructed. Sin is a result of the heart. That’s why Jesus said if you are angry with your brother without cause is danger of judgement and whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart (Matthew 5:21-32). 

So not only do we need to restore and ask for forgiveness from the person we harmed, but asked for forgiveness from God. Depending on the offense an animal without blemish (bull, goat, or lamb) was brought to the priest as a sin offering to request forgiveness from God (Leviticus 4).

“And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.” (Matthew 22: 37-40) from Deuteronomy 6:5 and “You shall not hate your brother in your heart…” Leviticus 19:17-18.

Jesus encompassed the tradition by being the Son of God, our high priest, and our spotless offering, the Lamb of God (John 1:29).  

Jesus is also the Son of God (Matthew 1:21-25). Jesus only did what God the Father did. And God gave Jesus, the Son, authority to judge. (John 5).

Jesus is our great high priest that understands our weakness since he was tempted, (Hebrews 4:14-16). “…one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.”

So, with sin being a condition of the heart, not just actions. We as humans are unable to fulfill all the requirements of the Law. (Romans 3:23). But nothing is impossible for God. This is why there was so much joy at the birth of Jesus who was prophesized throughout the Old Testament (Isaiah 52-53, Numbers 9:11–12 ESV; cf. Exodus 12:46 nor break any bones of Passover lamb). But Jesus completely fulfilled the requirements of the Law and be a spotless lamb.

Key Verses: Romans 8:1-11

Because of the Jesus death and resurrection, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). All we have to do, is … “confess with our mouths that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart God raised Him from the dead, and you will be saved.” (Romans 10:9). (Romans 8:6-8). And the same Spirit that raised Jesus dwells in you. That same Spirit will reshape your heart and change your desires to those that align with God’s Will. The Holy Spirit will start to take away the hurt and anger inside your heart. You start to not feel jealous about other’s accomplishments because they all can be used to glorify God’s Kingdom. You continue to weep for victims and also start to pray for the wicked that they change their hearts to know the real fullness of God.
